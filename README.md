# Windows NT Classic
Windows NT Classic is an Open-Source Web OS like [Windows 93](windows93.net) and [Windows 96](windows96.net) using a UI that looks like Windows Whistler while using as little libraries as possible and being somewhat lightweight. This is my first large public project so i appreciate if you starred this repository.

This Web OS features a easy to learn but powerful JavaScript Runtime Environment which includes:

 - Window Management
 - File System
 - Command Line Interface
 - Task Management
 
and much more...

## Info
As of now Windows NT Classic wont be Hosted 24/7 until the release of 1.0

This is unfinished, expect the the Desktop and JSRE to be nonfunctional or broken.

Windows NT Classic is using the MIT License. More details in LICENSE.txt
